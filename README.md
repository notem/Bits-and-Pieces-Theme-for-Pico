# More Bits and Pieces theme for Pico

I loved [lostkeys' Bits and Pieces Theme for Pico](https://github.com/lostkeys/Bits-and-Pieces-Theme-for-Pico) for it's clean and minimalistic approach.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite fit my needs; some personally adjustements were in order.

I've made adjustements to improve usability on both devices with large screens and mobile devices with very small-width screens.  This theme should be somewhat more acceptable for a public-facing website now. [My Pico CMS-based website](http://nmathe.ws) runs this theme; it may be used as a fair example of the theme.

Use at your own risk.  I can't imagine I've done anything to egregious, however my knowledge of CSS and HTML is very limited.
